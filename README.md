Objectives

The primary objectives of developing the scientific calculator program were:

To apply programming concepts such as stacks, expressions, and function evaluation in a practical scenario.

To build a command-line calculator capable of handling arithmetic expressions and scientific functions.

To understand and implement expression parsing and evaluation using custom stack structures.

To enhance skills in algorithm design and structured programming using Java.

Tasks and Responsibilities

During the development of the calculator program, the following tasks and responsibilities were undertaken:

Designed and implemented two stack structures: one for numeric values and another for operators.

Wrote logic to evaluate arithmetic expressions considering operator precedence and parentheses.

Integrated mathematical functions like sin, cos, tan, sqrt, log, and exp.

Handled edge cases such as invalid input, mismatched parentheses, and division by zero.

Developed the calculator using object-oriented principles and Java syntax standards.

Tested the calculator with various inputs to ensure accuracy and robustness.

Learning Outcomes

From this project, I was able to achieve the following learning outcomes:

Gained a deeper understanding of expression parsing techniques and stack-based evaluation algorithms.

Learned how to use conditional statements, loops, functions, and string handling in Java.

Strengthened problem-solving skills by managing complex inputs and functional requirements.

Practiced building object-oriented programs in Java.

Developed debugging and error-handling skills to make the calculator reliable for all valid inputs.

Challenges and Solutions

1. Parsing complex expressions (especially nested functions):
Challenge: Parsing functions like sin(cos(45)) was difficult due to nested parentheses.
Solution: Implemented recursive parsing by tracking the depth of parentheses and extracting the correct substring for function arguments.

2. Operator precedence and associativity:
Challenge: Ensuring correct evaluation order (e.g., 2 + 3 * 4 should give 14).
Solution: Used a precedence-check mechanism while pushing and popping operators from the stack.

3. Division by zero and invalid characters:
Challenge: User inputs could contain errors.
Solution: Incorporated robust error-checking and appropriate messages to prevent crashes.

4. Designing efficient logic in Java:
Challenge: Ensuring stack operations and expression handling were efficient and correct.
Solution: Utilized Java collections and structured control flow to manage the evaluation process.

Conclusion

My internship at ShadowFox provided valuable hands-on experience in the field of web
development. The exposure to various aspects of frontend and backend development, along
with real-world problem-solving, has significantly enhanced my skills and knowledge. This
experience has strengthened my interest in pursuing a career in web development and has
prepared me for the challenges and opportunities in the field.
